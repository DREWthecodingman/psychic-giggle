    <h1>Basic Tags</h1>
    
    <p>One of the most basic tags in an HTML5 document is the "<DOCTYPE html>" tag. This tag specifies that the file in question is a document written in HTML. Back in the early days of HTML, You had to specify the version, and write all of it in a tag, but thankfully they updated that.</p>
    <br>
     <p>Also, every document starts with an "<html>" tag. This specifies where to start the document.</p>
